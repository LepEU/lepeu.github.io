## European Lepidopteran Population Genomics Consortium

LepEU studies butterfly and moth biodiveristy across Europe.

We coordinate the sampling of wild populations of Lepidoptera across Europe, and use these collections to generate whole genome sequencing data from these populaion samples. Our goal is to conduct continental scale, comparative population genomic analyses of local adaptation, over space and time. 

Insect declines, especially among diverse Lepidoptera, are now well documented. By learning the landscape of evolutionary dynamics for diverse species, LepEU seeks to generate quantiative insights for biodiversity management at both the regional and EU level.

LepEU relies upon the 100's of chromosomal scale genomes generated by [Project Psyche](https://www.projectpsyche.org/). As they project to generate genomes for nearly all 11,000 Lepidoptera across Europe in the next 5 to 10 years, we seek to compliment these efforts with population genomic insights.
