## European Lepidopteran Population Genomics Consortium

**W**e are a collection of researchers focused upon sampling populations of Lepidoptera
species across Europe, to look for patterns of local adaptation across latitudes and through
seasons.  

Large scale genome sequencing initiatives are now focused upon generating high quality
reference genomes for diverse species, including Lepidoptera. By the end of 2024, [Project
Psyche](https://www.projectpsyche.org/) expects to generate 1000 genomes of European
Lepidoptera, with a goal of sequencing nearly all 11,000 within the coming 5 to 10 years.  

LepEU is focused upon using these emerging genomes to gain insights into the patterns of
local adaption across Europe, exploring how species adapt across latitudes, elevation, and
through seasons. We are currently focused upon field collections and will move into data
generation in the fall of 2024 for our currently targets species. Our aim is to generate
individual level re-sequencing data for diverse populations that are of shared interest to
LepEU members.
