## Focal Species
 <!-- TODO: Image or plate of species --> 
We currently have 25 species in the LepEU collection list.
This list was originally a set of 13 species, which in 2025 we expaneded to include all of the 
European Biodiversity Grassland Indicator species (n=17 species)

We therefore have sets of taxa that total to 25 species

Core set: this set is from 2024, including 5 of the European Biodiversity Grassland Indicator species
Extended set: now includes all of the remaining species in the European Biodiversity Grassland Indicator list

## Future Plans

 <!-- TODO: Image or plate of species --> 

We aim to collect data on a total of 35 species by 2030. These include the original 13 focal species above. Additional species will include all 17 (5 are on the original focal species list) European Grassland Butterfly indicator species. There also plans to expand sampling to moths by sampling 10 Moth species. Hence, by 2030 we aim to have population genomic data across Europe for 35 Lepidopteran Species.

## Helpful Resources for Identifying Species

Some species can be difficult to tell apart to distinguish between males and females. Below is a collection of links that might be useful in helping you distinguish species. Some of these links are specific to a region.
