## Resources for Identifying Species

Some species can be difficult to tell apart and/or to distinguish between males and females. Below is a collection of links that might be useful in helping you distinguish species. Some of these links are specific to a region.

- Official guides from [European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme](https://butterfly-monitoring.net/field-guides) with guides for various countries and sub-regions.

- [Turkish Butterfly Monitoring Scheme](https://butterfly-monitoring.net/tr/node/124) with identification materials!
