The [Population Genomics workshop](https://lepeu2025.sciencesconf.org/) of Working Group 4 of [10kLepGenomes COST action](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA23122/) (CA23122) will take place in Montpellier, France, from Monday 12th to Friday 16th May 2025.

This message is sent to everyone who registered to Working Group 4 (Population genomic analyses) within 10KLepGenomes. Sorry for possible cross-posting.

## Meeting Aims:
1. **Building the LepEU community**: 
   - Defining scientific objectives
   - Strengthening collaborations.
   - Discussing 2025 field priorities,
2. **Planning and coordinating data acquisition**
   - Coordinating collections, archiving, databasing
   - Coordinating DNA isolation from 2024 collections
   - Discuss funding solutions

## Who should come? 

We encourage researchers from all career stages that are interested in LepEU to come. There are a wide range of questions that regional sampling of European Lepidoptera could address. Let's see how we could make our individual efforts go further if we can collaborate together. We are inspired to keep building the LepEU community using a grass roots effort framework.

The total number of attendees we can fit is 30, including 18 attendees who can be reimbursed through the COST action (www.cost.eu/actions/CA23122), and about 12 people who can attend with their own funding. See down below for possible travel cost reimbursements.

## Location  

The workshop will start on Monday 12th May in the later afternoon in Montpellier. We will meet in town. Tuesday-Thursday meeting and DNA workshops will take place at the University of Montpellier (43.6322, 3.8664) and CNRS (43.6386, 3.8645) north of the city centre. We propose to have a field outing on Friday.

## DNA isolation 

For those needing DNA extraction help, we propose to provide a solution to isolate DNA during that week. This is aimed primarily to help people who might find it difficult to do that in their own institution. If you are interested, you need to register your samples so we can plan extraction consumables. We will reach out individually.

Please **register** to the workshop using the link below, by Sunday 23rd March.
