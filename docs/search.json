    "text": "LepEU is part of the recently funded 10kLepGenomes COST Action Network. This network has 5 working groups (1.Societal needs; 2.Speciment collection for genomic work; 3.Reference genome assembly and comparative genomic analyses; 4.Population genomic analyses; 5.Applied uses of results). LepEU interests primarily fall within WG2 and WG4, while Psyche interests fall with WG2 and WG4. But, we all likely have some interest in more working groups.\nThe COST action means that we have funding for our community to attend in person meetings, organize student placements and run training events. These interactions will also allow us to transport samples, coordinate DNA extractions, and develop our community in connection with Psyche and others. In the immediate future, we are looking forward to planning an in-person meeting to discuss regional sampling, DNA extractions, methods and analyses.\nTo benefit from this funding and attend meetings and workshops organized by this action, you need to be registered to the COST action. You can sign up to 1-3 working groups depending on your interests. You can read more about the action and sign up here: https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA23122/\nWhen applying to join, you will be asked to provide a brief summary of your motivation and how you would contribute to the working group. This does not need to be in depth but including details of what interests you, and what you would like to see planned, will be extremely useful in shaping what we will achieve during the action.\nEarly-career researchers, including students, are particularly encouraged to join as the action will provide exciting opportunities for training, engaging in exchanges and attending meetings. Please feel free to share the invite with your lab members and others that you think would be interested in joining.\nSo, please go and sign-up ASAP (before October 1)."

This network has 5 working groups (1.Societal needs; 2.Speciment collection for genomic work; 3.Reference genome assembly and comparative genomic analyses; 4.Population genomic analyses; 5.Applied uses of results). LepEU is directly supported by WG4, Population Genomic analyses. We intimately rely upon WG2 and WG3. Similarily, Psyche is directly supported by WG2 and WG3.\nThe COST action means that we have funding for our community to attend in person meetings, organize student placements and run training events. These interactions will also allow us to transport samples, coordinate DNA extractions, and develop our community in connection with Psyche and others.\nIn May (12-16), we held an in-person meeting to discuss LepEU goals, regional sampling, protocols, and strategize for the future. We also used this support to gather samples and extract DNA from nearly 500 field collections.\nTo benefit from this funding and attend meetings and workshops organized by this action, you need to be registered to the COST action. You can sign up to 1-3 working groups depending on your interests. Again, sign up to at least WG4 for LepEU related activities.\nYou can read more about the action and sign up here: https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA23122/\n\n\nCarl Tryggers Foundation\nLepEU is focused upon helping individual researchers obtain national level funding to support both national and international focused population genomics of Lepidoptera. In 2024, Chris Wheat at Stockholm University was awarded funding to support Phase 1 of LepEU. Funding will support a 2 year postdoc and nearly 30,000 Euros in sequencing funds.\n\n\n\nFinancial support\n Support for the objectives of LepEU can also come in the form of sequencing support from various sources.\n\nWellcome Sanger Institute\nLepEU is receiving substantial support from Psyche and the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the form of generating whole genome resequencing data for our Phase 1 collections from the UK and Switzerland.\nWellcome Sanger Institute has also offered support for eventually hosting various output from LepEU in the form of VCF file integration with the revised LepBase genomics database.

    "text": "Montpellier, France — LepEU1 (European Lepidopteran Population Genomics Consortium) studies diversity patterns and local adaptation of butterflies and moths over space and time through a comparative population genomics approach. From 12 to 16 May, 21 researchers from across Europe2 convened in Montpellier for the first LepEU Workshop, a meeting dedicated to coordinating collecting efforts and discussing the research goals and future applications in conservation and pest management. The event was supported by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action 10kLepGenomes.\nButterflies are a key study group to showcase the utility of genomic knowledge to understand and protect biodiversity. Butterfly ecology is well documented in research and museums, some species have great economic impact (pollinators and pests), or serve as key bioindicators for conservation. The size of their genomes allow efficient reference genome assembly and population genomics work. They are the target of active citizen science programmes and are powerful for outreach. LepEU aims at leveraging all the merits of butterflies to foster biodiversity research using population genomic approaches.\n\n\n1. Sampling Priorities: Participants agreed to prioritize the completion of sampling of populations across Europe and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for 13 core butterfly species — with top priority on Pieris napi, Anthocharis cardamines, Pararge aegeria, and Maniola jurtina. Meanwhile, sampling of an additional 12 species, including grassland indicators and day-flying moths, will continue throughout the season .\n2. Standardized Protocols: The role of national coordinators was established for each participating country to facilitate specimens’ collection together with local researchers. Shared protocols for sampling, preparation and metadata archiving were adopted to improve standardization and interoperability of generated datasets with other major biodiversity initiatives, such as the Darwin Tree of Life Project (DTOL) and the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA).\n3. Hands-On Laboratory Work: During the meeting, and coordinated by Dr.Mathieu Joron (CNRS, France), workshop participants conducted approximately 500 DNA extractions in the Centre d’Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive laboratories. The samples corresponded to 21 species collected by 15 researchers in 34 localities across 7 European countries. The DNA extractions will be ready for WGS in the coming months, representing a milestone for LepEU.\n\n\n\nLooking to the future, the LepEU consortium outlined an ambitious roadmap:\n\nExpanding Species Coverage: The initiative will now extend to all 17 butterfly species used in the European Grassland Butterfly Indicator, as well as 10 widespread and easily identifiable moth species, thus contributing to the EU Pollinators Initiative.\nGenetic Diversity Monitoring: The project will generate and analyze genomic data necessary to estimate genetic diversity indicators, as required under the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\nTemporal Insights via Museum Samples: A key goal will be to assess changes in genetic diversity over time driven by anthropogenic activities using historical specimens archived at museum collections.\nCapacity Building: A training school focused on analyzing WGS data and targeting early career researchers will be organized in 2026, offering hands-on practice to analyze WGS data for comparative population genomics.\nSecuring Support: The consortium will actively seek funding to support the continued sampling, sequencing, and analysis efforts across Europe.\n\nDr Patrícia Beldade summarized the collective sentiment: \n\n\n“This meeting has strengthened our scientific vision and built the foundations for a lasting collaborative effort. By combining resources, expertise and data, we are paving the way for an unprecedented understanding of butterfly population genomics in Europe.”"
